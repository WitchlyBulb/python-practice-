'''Drill 9: Identify Highest-Risk Patients Across Dataset
Goal:
Loop through all patients and visits, generate alerts (like Drill 8), 
and then highlight the patients with the highest number of high-risk alerts across all visits.
Requirements:
Per-visit alerts (all rules from Drill 8: Fever, Heart Rate, BP, Labs, Symptoms, Trends).
Track total number of alerts per patient across all visits.
At the end, print the patient(s) with the most alerts.
Print summary for each patient as before.
Expected Sample Output (rough idea):
Patient: Mia
 Visit 1:
   - Fever
   - High BP
   - Possible Infection
 Visit 2:
   - Fever
   - High heart rate
   - High BP
   - Chest Pain Alert
   - Possible Infection
   - High Blood Sugar
Patient: Liam
 Visit 1:
   Stable
 Visit 2:
   - Fever
   - High heart rate
   - Glucose Increasing
   - Breathing Alert
   - High Blood Sugar
Patient: Emma
 Visit 1:
   - Fever
   - High BP
   - Chest Pain Alert
   - High Blood Sugar
--- Highest Risk Patients ---
  - Mia (6 alerts)
Challenge Tasks for You (no solution given yet):
Use your Drill 8 logic for alerts per visit.
Track total alert count per patient across all visits.
After processing all patients, identify the patient(s) with the most alerts.
Output should be clean, with patient name once, visits indented, and summary clearly separated.'''
